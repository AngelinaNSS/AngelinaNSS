# Title: Automating Healthy Habits: 

My project was to create a Reminder System for Daily Vitamin Intake, Using PyCharm
In the fast-paced world we live in, it's easy to forget the small but significant habits that contribute to our overall well-being. One such habit is taking daily vitamins, which I forget almost everyday unless I am reminded, or if i've written it down.
For me, as well as many other people, taking daily vitmains can play a crucial role in maintaining our health. 
However, remembering to take them consistently can be a challenge. 
To address this issue, I wanted to create an automation project using PyCharm to create a reminder system tailored to my needs.

Design:
The first step in this project was to outline the requirements for the reminder system. I wanted a solution that would remind me at a specific time each day to take my vitamins, while also being customizable and easy to maintain. 
PyCharm was the perfect environment for building such a system. (as I've learned using ubuntu, which did not work for me on my mac)
I started by creating a Python script for the reminder.
I utilized libraries such as datetime to manage time-related operations. (with sources of goodle websites and chatgpt I was able to create this)

The functionality of my reminder system revolves around scheduling daily reminders.
Using Pycharm, I was able to continuously check the current time and trigger reminders when the specified time arrived. PyCharm's debugging capabilities were very invaluable for meduring this phase, helping me identify and fix any issues efficiently.
PyCharm's features like syntax highlighting, and version control integration, increased my productivity and saved time. 

With the built-in terminal it also provided a convenient way for me to execute and test the script within the same environment.

The benefits of automating my daily vitamin intake with this reminder system have been significant!
Not only have I become more consistent in taking my vitamins, but I've also experienced improvements in my overall health and well-being. 
As I mentioned in my blog, coming from a country that experiences long dark winters, it is crucial for my health to take certian vitamins like vitamin D or vitamin B12,
these vitamins play an important role on my energy levels, and mood.
By leveraging the power of automation through PyCharm, I've effectively eliminated the hassle of remembering this important habit, freeing up mental energy for other tasks.

With this project I've developed a solution that integrates into my daily routine, 
helping me maintain optimal health with minimal effort. 
As technology continues to evolve, I believe projects like this demonstrate the endless possibilities for leveraging automation to improve our lives, especially for our health.
