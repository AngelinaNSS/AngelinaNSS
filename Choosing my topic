  The topic I chose to base my Automation Project and blog around, was Nutrition, and the integration of using AI combined with nutrition in the future.
This topic interested me to write about, because I am curious about how the human body works and how it's affected by the foods we eat. Nutrition is more than just a field of study for me; it's a passion, and a lifestyle influenced by personal experiences, and a desire for holistic well-being. Learning about nutrition has been an interest of mine since highschool. 
I also had the opportunity to take classes on nutrition and human anatomy in the past, and these experiences have inspired me to further learn about the importance of “good nutrition” and how human advancements in technology can help human beings in the future.
The more I learned, the more I realized the importance of nutrition on various aspects of health, from physical to mental well-being.
The topic of Nutrition relates to me, because in the future I aspire to work in the field of nutritional science. As long as I can remember my family and I have always incorporated healthy foods into our lives, and from a young age I’ve been taught the importance of consuming healthy foods. 
We often experimented with different recipes of “plant based foods” and created our own new recipes based on the foods that we were able to grow in our garden.
With this topic of nutrition, I am also fascinated about the future potential in our technological advancements and how this can be used to help human beings from a medical point of view. 
In my blog I discuss “the future of Artificial Intelligence,” and future possible technologies that can be implemented in medical nutrition to benefit humans, and to optimize health. For my automation project, I created an alarm/reminder system to remind me to take my vitamins everyday at a certain time.

In essence, my decision to write my blog and create an automation project based on the topic of nutrition stems from a deeply personal connection, fueled by curiosity, and driven by a desire for well-being.
As I continue on this journey, I am reminded of the meaningful impact that nutrition has on every aspect of our lives and am devoted to sharing this knowledge to empower others to make informed choices and embark on their own paths to health and vitality.
